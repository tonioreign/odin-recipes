    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate</li>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 egg whites</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher for Passover vanilla flavoring</li>
      <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
      <li>¼ cup matzo cake meal</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons potato starch</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons matzo cake meal</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 8x8-inch baking
        pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt unsweetened chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over
        simmering water; stir to mix well. Beat the eggs and egg whites together
        in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until very fluffy,
        about 5 minutes. Gently stir the butter and chocolate mixture, sugar,
        coffee, and vanilla flavoring into the egg mixture, and beat well to
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together all of the potato starch, all of the matzo cake meal, cocoa
        powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat the dry ingredients into the chocolate
        mixture with electric mixer until fluffy and thoroughly combined. Gently
        fold the chocolate chips into the batter, and divide between the 2
        prepared baking dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
        a pan shows moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
